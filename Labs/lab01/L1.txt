CPS393 LAB 01:

   commands:  cd, ls, pwd, cp, mkdir, vim, chmod

------------------------------------
 Part 1
------------------------------------

1. Move around directories, list entries in directories, and verify current directory
   using:  cd, ls, pwd commands as follows:

   Move into your home directory:  cd
   Move into the course directory: cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/
   List the entries there:         ls
   Change into the labs directory  cd labs
   List the entries there:         ls
   Change into the first lab       cd lab01
   List the entries there:         ls

   Change back into your HOME directory:  cd
   Move back-and-forth between your home directory and the preivous directory
   (/usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab01) by using the following command over and over:
   cd -
   Each time you change directories, verify you are in the correct directory by
   using the following command:
   pwd

2. Use mkdir to create directories as follows:
   Move into your home directory:  cd
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Make directory cps393:          mkdir cps393
   Verify it was created:          ls
   Move into dir cps393:           cd cps393
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Make dir labs:                  mkdir labs
   Verify it was created:          ls
   Move into dir labs:             cd labs
   Make directories lab01, lab02, lab03, lab04, ... lab09:
                                   mkdir lab01 lab02 lab03 lab04 lab05 lab06 lab07 lab08 lab09
   Verify they were created:       ls
   Move into lab01:                cd lab01


3. Use cp to copy file(s):
   Move into the lab01 directory in the course account:
                                   cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab01
                                   pwd
                                   ls
   Move into your own lab01 dir:   cd ~/cps393/labs/lab01
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Copy file myInfo.txt from the course lab01 dir into your own lab01 dir:
            cp /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab01/myInfo.txt .
   Verify it was copied over:      ls
   Copy file vimTutorial.txt from your home dir into your lab01 dir:
                                   cd
                                   ls
                                   cp vimTutorial.txt cps393/labs/lab01/. 
   Verify your lab01 dir contains vimTutorial.txt and your lab01 dir contains myInfo.txt 
                                   cd
                                   cd cps393/labs
                                   pwd
                                   ls lab01
                                   ls lab01
   If they're not there, repeat the above.


4. Fill in myInfo.txt file:
   Move into your lab01 dir:       cd 
                                   cd cps393
                                   cd labs/lab01
                                   pwd
                                   ls
   Edit myInfo.txt:                vim myInfo.txt
   NOW USE VIM TO FILL IN YOUR NAME, SID, LOGIN, WHERE INDICATED, LEAVING
   A SPACE AFTER EACH COLON



5. Look at the man page for the ls command:  man ls
   Find an option of the "ls" command that lists directory contents so that color is 
   used to distinguish file types. 

   Remember: when you're in a man page, "space bar" goes down a page, "b" goes back up a page,
   "enter" goes down one line, "/abc" searches for the string "abc", "n" searches for the
   next "abc", "q" quits the man page.


------------------------------------
 Part 2
------------------------------------

1. Move into your cps393 directory 
   From within cps393, do the ls command with the option you found above (so the contents 
   will be listed in color.)
   Use output redirection (the ">" character) to capture the output of this ls command into
   a file named lab01q01

2. Use chmod to change some permissions on your files/dirs as follows:
   file myInfo.txt has permissions rw- for user, --x for group, and --- for other.
   directory labs has permissions  rwx for user, r-x for group, and --- for other.
   
3. Move into your home directory and verify you're there.

   From within your home directory, use the ls command to get a long listing for 
   myInfo.txt and labs as follows:
   Specify myInfo.txt using an ABSOLUTE path name. 
   Specify labs       using an RELATIVE path name. (hint: ..)
   Your command should look like the following (with ### replaced appropriately)":
   ls -ld ######myInfo.txt ######labs
   Use the mouse to copy and paste the actual ls command you used into file lab01q03:
      -"select" whole ls command with the mouse so it's hilighted (which is "copy" in putty). 
      -vim lab01q3
      -open a new line: o
      -right-click mouse (which is "paste" in putty)
      -press escape a couple of times
      -:wq to save and exit


4. Use output redirection (the ">") to capture the OUTPUT from your ls command from
   question 3, and put it into file lab01q04
